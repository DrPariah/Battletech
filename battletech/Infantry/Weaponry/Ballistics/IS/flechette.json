    "description": "The 'Firedrake' Incendiary Support Needler is a support weapon produced by Mauser & Gray Firearms for the Lyran Alliance. First introduced in 3061, the 'Firedrake' continues in the spirit of previous weapons like the Shredder Heavy Needler on improving the range and power of traditional flechette-based weapons, this time by combining a high rate-of-fire and superior range with the incendiary properties of its special ammunition. A single ten-shot burst of these white-hot needles can cover a broad area, allowing the 'Firedrake' to saturate a full squad of enemy soldiers and ignite the surrounding terrain in a blaze in less than five seconds, though it has no effect on armored units such as combat vehicles or battle armor as the flechettes simply bounce off.",

    "description": "The Needler Rifle is a vicious weapon that fires a spray of tiny fletchettes that can easily shred flesh. These fletchettes are created by shredding a polymer-composite block and fired by a burst of compressed gas, making the weapon noiseless with little to no recoil and the favorite choice of assassins. However, it is an incredibly short-ranged weapon with almost no armor penetration capabilities. This limits its use to self-defense and close-quarters combat, though it serves as an ideal weapon for boarding space-vessels.",
