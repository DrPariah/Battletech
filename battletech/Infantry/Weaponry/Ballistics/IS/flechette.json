    "description": "The 'Firedrake' Incendiary Support Needler is a support weapon produced by Mauser & Gray Firearms for the Lyran Alliance. First introduced in 3061, the 'Firedrake' continues in the spirit of previous weapons like the Shredder Heavy Needler on improving the range and power of traditional flechette-based weapons, this time by combining a high rate-of-fire and superior range with the incendiary properties of its special ammunition. A single ten-shot burst of these white-hot needles can cover a broad area, allowing the 'Firedrake' to saturate a full squad of enemy soldiers and ignite the surrounding terrain in a blaze in less than five seconds, though it has no effect on armored units such as combat vehicles or battle armor as the flechettes simply bounce off.",

Resembling a small, wide-barreled rifle, the Shredder is designed specifically to overcome the usual ineffectiveness of flechettes against armor. Its high-speed cutters launch heavy flechette rounds at much greater speeds than normal, allowing them to penetrate armored targets more effectively.",
