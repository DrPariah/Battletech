A single ten-shot burst of these white-hot needles can cover a broad area, allowing the 'Firedrake' to saturate a full squad of enemy soldiers and ignite the surrounding terrain in a blaze in less than five seconds, though it has no effect on armored units such as combat vehicles or battle armor as the fléchettes simply bounce off.",
