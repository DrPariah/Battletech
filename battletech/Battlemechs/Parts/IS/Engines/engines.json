    "description": "The fusion engine is capable of powering 'Mechs, Aerospace Fighters, and other vehicles. Fusion engines function by harnessing the power of a fusion reaction, as occurs in the core of the Sun. A BattleMech's fusion engine can usually last for decades on a few kilograms of hydrogen. Unlike the research reactors of the real world, a BattleMech's fusion engine runs on 'light' hydrogen, protium, rather than hydrogen's heavier isotopes deuterium and tritium.",
