# Rules

* Keep it to lore, with exceptions.
* Custom Vehicles/BA/'Mech designs can only be from MegaMekLab or from Sarna.net.
* Tiles are considered 1.55 meters. Don't ask, it took a while. A long while.
* @Lord Rod, Lord of Rods [COM] for the vehicle speed rework, I approximated car width in meters as `0.4 * (tiles width) + 0.5<= 5`, or `2.5 + ( tiles - 5 ) * 0.15m` for larger vehicles.
* Damage is calculated using the Base Damage, times `((15.5x)/2)`, with x being the base damage.
